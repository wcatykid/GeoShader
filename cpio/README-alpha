This is the GNU cpio package.
This document describes the actions needed to build the pre-release

* Introduction

This is a *pre-release* version, and not ready for production use
yet. If you are taking source from Git, you will need to have several
special tools to help contribute. See the file README-hacking for more
information, See chapter `Building' for the detailed instructions on
how to build the package.

Please, note that the accompanying documentation may be inaccurate
or incomplete. The Git logs are the authoritative documentation of
all recent changes. You may convert them to the traditional ChangeLog
format by running `make ChangeLog'.
